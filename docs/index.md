Good evening, everyone!

Today I’m going to present a project I developed: a 4-bit binary adder using Arduino.

The idea is to show, in a simple and practical way, how binary addition logic works inside a digital system, using buttons for input and LEDs to display the result.

Throughout the presentation, I’ll explain how the system was assembled, how the code works, and how anyone can use this project to better understand concepts of electronics and programming.

Let’s get started!
