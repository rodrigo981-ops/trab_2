## Project Installation/Project installation instructions.

To assemble and install the project, we used simple components that, together, form an efficient logical system:

1 Arduino UNO board
8 push buttons
5 LEDs (4 for the result bits and 1 for the final carry)
220-ohm resistors for the LEDs
A breadboard to build the circuit
Jumper wires for the connections

The buttons were connected to the Arduinoâ€™s digital pins 0 to 7, with the first 4 representing the first number and the remaining 4 representing the second number.
The output LEDs were connected to pins 8 to 12, with the first 4 indicating the sum result and pin 12 representing the final carry.

The assembly was done neatly, respecting the correct placement of the resistors, avoiding short circuits, and maintaining a clear and logical layout.

After completing the physical setup, the code was uploaded using the Arduino IDE. Through the USB cable, we uploaded the program, and within seconds, the system was up and running, ready for testing.
